# Paper:  Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive Models via Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for reproducing the results in the paper titled ***" Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive Models via Convolutional Neural Networks."*** 

We have described the method used in the [`manuscript`]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04341.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03034)) here along with providing the Python notebook. The code in this repository is made available primarily for reproducibility purposes, and we encourage readers interested in using the to use the trained neural network model to for model fit.

## [Python Interface](https://colab.research.google.com/)
One can get started with the code using Google Colab. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that supports Python, enabling you to write and execute code collaboratively and interactively.
